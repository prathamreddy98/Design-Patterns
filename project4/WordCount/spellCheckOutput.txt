The earliest noted adventures of humans with coding take us back to 60 AD Heron of Alexander was a Greek mathematician and engineer. He invented the machine that was used to control puppets with the help of strings. The machine could be reprogrammed by rearranging the strings to make the puppets do different things.It can be said that the machine was programmed to make the puppets do certain things and also had scope for reprogramming.
From here the next big leap in programming was the Jacquard Loom. In the 18th century in France Joseph Mary Jacquard invented the machine that was used to create prints on rugs and carpets. This machine worked on metal punch cards that the machine would read and weave a pattern accordingly. Thus you could simply change the cards and the machine would be reprogrammed to print differently.
I drove all the way in my trailer to the store to buy cookies. I stood in the line for 1 hour which disturbed my schedule. I came back home and hid the cookies in my room. Then someone ate my Biscuits without asking and I got mad. I spent alot on those cookies, now I have to again go to the Shop.
